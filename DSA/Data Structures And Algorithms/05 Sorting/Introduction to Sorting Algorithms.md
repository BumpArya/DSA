Introduction to Sorting Algorithms:
    Sorting is the arrangement of elements in increasing or decreasing order.

Criteria for Analysis:
    Time Complexity: Efficiency for different data set sizes.
    Space Complexity: Amount of memory used.
    Stability: Preservation of relative order for equal elements.
    In-place algorithm: meaning it doesn't require additional space beyond the input array.
    Adaptivity: Ability to handle pre-sorted data efficiently.
    Recursive: Use of recursion in the algorithm.
