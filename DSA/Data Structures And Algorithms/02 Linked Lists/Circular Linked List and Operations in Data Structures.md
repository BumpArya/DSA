**Introduction to Circular Linked Lists:**
    Unlike linear linked lists, circular linked lists have no end node; the last element points to the first.
    The absence of a NULL pointer indicates the circular nature.
	While circular linked lists have no start, the head pointer serves as a reference point for operations.

**Operations on Circular Linked Lists:**
    Operations are similar to linear linked lists, with **traversal** being a key operation.
    Traversal involves iterating through the list until the pointer returns to the head, visiting each node once. (use Do While loops)
	To **insert** a node at the beginning of a circular linked list:
		1. Allocate memory for a new node.
		2. Set its data.
		3. Traverse until the last node.
		4. Connect the last node to the new node.
		5. Connect the new node to the head.
		6. Update the head pointer to the new node.
		7. Return the new head pointer.
