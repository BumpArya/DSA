**Introduction to Doubly Linked Lists**: 
	Doubly linked lists differ from singly linked lists in that each node contains two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node. 
	This structure allows traversal in both directions.

**Implementation in C**: 
	
	struct Node {
	    int data;
	    Struct Node* next;
	    Struct Node* prev;
	};

**Operations on Doubly Linked Lists**: 
	Insertion and deletion operations on doubly linked lists are similar to those on singly linked lists, but they require adjusting both the `next` and `prev` pointers.
