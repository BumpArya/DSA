Let's convert the infix expression 𝑥+𝑦∗𝑧−𝑘 to its postfix equivalent using the stack method:
1. Start traversing from the left.
2. The first operand is 𝑥, so concatenate it to the postfix string.
3. The next operator is +, push it onto the stack.
4. Next operand is 𝑦, concatenate it to the postfix string.
5. Next operator is ∗, which has higher precedence than +, so push it onto the stack.
6. Next operand is 𝑧, concatenate it to the postfix string.
7. The next operator is −, which has lower precedence than ∗, so we pop ∗ from the stack and concatenate it to the postfix string.
8. The next operator in the stack +, which has same precedence as −, so we pop + from the stack and concatenate it to the postfix string. Then push − onto the stack.
9. The final operand is 𝑘, concatenate it to the postfix string.
10. We've reached the end of the expression, but there's still one operator (−) in the stack. Pop it and concatenate it to the postfix string.
Following these steps, the postfix equivalent of the infix expression ((𝑥+(𝑦∗𝑧))−𝑘) is 𝑥𝑦𝑧∗+𝑘−
