**Time Complexity** 
Is the study of the efficiency of algorithms. It tells us how much time is taken by an algorithm to process a given input

**Big O notation**
Is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 
It provides a way to classify algorithms according to their efficiency in terms of time and space.

In Big O notation, "O" stands for "order of" or "order." 
When we say an algorithm has a time complexity of O(f(n)) or space complexity of O(f(n)), 
It means that the algorithm's performance grows at most proportional to the function f(n) as the size of the input (denoted by n) increases. 
Here, "n" typically represents the size of the input data.

**Visualizing Big O**
If we were to plot O(1) and O(n) on a graph, they would look something like this:
